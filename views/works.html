            <b>1985–1992: The Fresh Prince</b> <br />
            at the Emmy Awards 1993 Smith started as the MC of the hip-hop duo
            DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, with his childhood friend Jeffrey
            "DJ Jazzy Jeff" Townes as turntablist and producer. Townes and Smith
            were introduced to each other by chance in 1985, as Townes was
            performing at a house party only a few doors down from Smith's
            residence, and he was missing his hype man. Smith decided to fill
            in. They both felt strong chemistry, and Townes was upset when his
            hype man finally made it to the party. <br />Soon after, the two
            decided to join forces. Smith enlisted a friend to join as the
            beatboxer of the group, Clarence Holmes aka Ready Rock C, making
            them a trio. Philadelphia-based Word Records released their first
            single in 1986 when A&R man Paul Oakenfold introduced them to
            Champion Records with their single "Girls Ain't Nothing but
            Trouble," a tale of funny misadventures that landed Smith and his
            former DJ and rap partner Mark Forrest (Lord Supreme) in trouble.
            The song sampled the theme song of "I Dream of Jeannie." Smith
            became known for light-hearted story-telling raps and capable,
            though profanity-free, "battle" rhymes. The single became a hit a
            month before Smith graduated from high school.<br />
            Based on this success, the duo were brought to the attention of Jive
            Records and Russell Simmons. The duo's first album, Rock the House,
            which was first released on Word Up in 1986 debuted on Jive in March
            1987. The group received the first Grammy Award for Best Rap
            Performance in 1989 for "Parents Just Don't Understand" (1988),
            though their most successful single was "Summertime" (1991), which
            earned the group their second Grammy and peaked at number 4 on the
            Billboard Hot 100. Smith and Townes are still friends and claim that
            they never split up, having made songs under Smith's solo performer
            credit.<br />
            Smith spent money freely around 1988 and 1989 and underpaid his
            income taxes. The Internal Revenue Service eventually assessed a
            $2.8 million tax debt against Smith, took many of his possessions,
            and garnished his income. Smith was struggling financially in 1990
            when the NBC television network signed him to a contract and built a
            sitcom, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, around him. The show was
            successful and began his acting career. Smith set for himself the
            goal of becoming "the biggest movie star in the world", studying box
            office successes' common characteristics] In 1989, Smith was
            arrested in relation to an alleged assault on his record promoter,
            William Hendricks; the charges were later dismissed] <br><br />
            <b>1993-1997: Solo music and film breakthrough</b> <br />Smith's
            first major roles were in the drama Six Degrees of Separation (1993)
            and the action film Bad Boys (1995) in which he starred opposite
            Martin Lawrence. The latter film was commercially successful,
            grossing $141.4 million worldwide. However, critical reception was
            generally mixed In 1996, Smith starred as part of an ensemble cast
            in Roland Emmerich's Independence Day. The film was a massive
            blockbuster, becoming the second highest-grossing film in history at
            the time and establishing Smith as a prime box office draw. <br />In
            the summer of 1997, he starred alongside Tommy Lee Jones in the hit
            Men in Black, playing Agent J. The film was released on July 2 by
            Columbia Pictures and grossed over $589.3 million worldwide against
            a $90 million budget, becoming the year's third highest-grossing
            film, with an estimated 54,616,700 tickets sold in the US. It
            received positive reviews, with critics praising its humor, as well
            as Jones's and Smith's performances.<br />
            During the summer of 1997, Smith also began his solo music career
            with the release of "Men in Black", the theme song for the film,
            which topped singles charts in several regions across the world,
            including the UK. "Men in Black" (and second single "Just Cruisin'
            ") was later included on Smith's debut solo album Big Willie Style,
            which reached the top ten of the US Billboard 200 and was certified
            nine times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America
            (RIAA). The third single from the album, "Gettin' Jiggy wit It",
            became Smith's first Billboard Hot 100 number one when it was
            released in 1998. <br><br /><b>1998–2007: Leading man status</b> <br>Smith in
            1999 In 1998, Smith starred with Gene Hackman in Enemy of the State.
            The following year he turned down the role of Neo in The Matrix in
            favor of Wild Wild West (1999). Despite the disappointment of Wild
            Wild West, Smith said that he has no regrets about his decision,
            asserting that Keanu Reeves's performance as Neo was superior to
            what Smith himself would have achieved, although in interviews
            subsequent to the release of Wild Wild West he said that he "made a
            mistake on Wild Wild West. That could have been better."<br> Smith's
            second album was again supported by the release of a film theme song
            as the lead single: "Wild Wild West", featuring Dru Hill and Kool
            Moe Dee, topped the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified gold by the
            RIAA.The album in question, Willennium, reached number five on the
            Billboard 200 and was certified double platinum by the RIAA.] "Will
            2K", the second single from the album, reached number 25 on the
            Billboard Hot 100. Before the end of 1999, a video album was
            released featuring Smith's seven music videos released to date,
            which reached number 25 on the UK Music Video Chart. The same year,
            he was also featured on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air co-star Tatyana
            Ali's single "Boy You Knock Me Out", which reached number three on
            the UK Singles Chart and topped the UK R&B Singles Chart.<br> Smith
            portrayed heavyweight boxer Muhammad Ali in the 2001 biopic Ali. For
            his performance he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best
            Actor, and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture
            Drama. In 2002, following a four-year musical hiatus, Smith returned
            with his third album Born to Reign, which reached number 13 on the
            Billboard 200 and was certified gold by the RIAA.The album's lead
            single was the theme song from Smith's film Men in Black II, called
            "Black Suits Comin' (Nod Ya Head)", which reached number three on
            the UK Singles Chart. Later in the year, Smith's first compilation
            album Greatest Hits was released, featuring songs from his three
            solo albums as well as those produced with DJ Jazzy Jeff.<br> 2003 saw
            Smith return for Bad Boys II, the sequel to the 1995 film Bad Boys;
            the film follows detectives Burnett and Lowrey investigating the
            flow of ecstasy into Miami. Despite receiving generally negative
            reviews, the film was a box-office success, grossing $270 million
            worldwide. In the following year, he starred in the science fiction
            film I, Robot and the animated film Shark Tale; both films were box
            office successes despite mixed reviews. Smith's latest album Lost
            and Found was released in 2005, peaking at number six on the
            Billboard 200. Lead single "Switch" reached the top ten of both the
            Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart. In 2005, Smith was
            entered into the Guinness Book of World Records for attending three
            premieres in a 24-hour time span. Smith and his son Jaden played
            father and son in the 2006 biographical drama The Pursuit of
            Happyness. In the film Smith portrays Chris Gardner. Smith first
            became interested in making a film about Gardner after seeing him on
            20/20 and connected with him during production. The film, along with
            Smith's performance, received praise. Smith hosting the 2011 Walmart
            Shareholders Meeting On December 10, 2007, Smith was honored at
            Grauman's Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard. Smith left an
            imprint of his hands and feet outside the theater in front of many
            fans. Later that month, Smith starred in the film I Am Legend,
            released on December 14, 2007. Alongside marginally positive
            reviews, its opening was the largest ever for a film released in the
            United States during December. Smith himself has said that he
            considers the film to be "aggressively unique". A reviewer said that
            the film's commercial success "cemented standing as the number one
            box office draw in Hollywood." On December 1, 2008, TV Guide
            reported that Smith was selected as one of America's top ten most
            fascinating people of 2008 for a Barbara Walters ABC special that
            aired on December 4, 2008.<br><br><b>2008–2019: Blockbusters and critical
                disappointments </b> <br>In 2008, Smith was reported to be developing a film
            entitled The Last Pharaoh, in which he would be starring as Taharqa.
            Smith later starred in the superhero movie Hancock,which grossed
            $227,946,274 in the United States and Canada and had a worldwide
            total of $624,386,746.On August 19, 2011, it was announced that
            Smith returned to the studio with producer La Mar Edwards to work on
            his fifth studio album. Smith again reprised his role as Agent J
            with Men in Black 3, which opened on May 25, 2012, his first major
            starring role in four years. After the release of the film, Smith
            was content with ending his work with the franchise, saying, "I
            think three is enough for me. Three of anything is enough for me.
            We'll look at it and we'll consider it, but it feels like that it
            might be time to let someone else do that." Men in Black 3, released
            ten years after Men in Black II (2002), grossed over $624 million
            worldwide. Unadjusted for inflation, it is the highest-grossing film
            in the series. In 2013, Smith starred in After Earth with his son
            Jaden. The film was a disappointment at the domestic box office and
            was panned critically. Calling the film "the most painful failure in
            my career", Smith ended up taking a year and a half break as a
            result. Smith and Suicide Squad co-star Margot Robbie in 2016 Smith
            starred opposite Margot Robbie in the romance drama Focus, released
            on February 27, 2015. He played Nicky Spurgeon, a veteran con artist
            who takes a young, attractive woman under his wing. Smith was set to
            star in the sci-fi thriller Brilliance, an adaptation of Marcus
            Sakey's novel of the same name scripted by Jurassic Park writer
            David Koepp, but he left the project to work on the Ridley
            Scott-produced sports drama Concussion. In Concussion, Smith played
            Dr. Bennet Omalu of the Brain Injury Research Institute, the first
            to discover chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Smith reported he had
            doubts about the film early in the production, saying, "some of my
            happiest memories are of watching my son catch and throw a football.
            I didn't want to be the guy who did a movie saying football could be
            dangerous." These views subsided when he met Omalu, whose words
            about American ideals resonated with Smith. Smith's performance was
            praised for being "sensitive understated".In 2016, Smith played
            Deadshot in the supervillain team-up action film Suicide Squad.
            Smith's participation in the film meant choosing it over a role in
            Independence Day: Resurgence, which he said would be like "clinging
            and clawing backwards." While Suicide Squad was a massive financial
            success, earning over $700 million at the box office, the film
            received negative reviews from critics. Christopher Orr, film critic
            from The Atlantic described the film writing "The latest offering
            from the DC Comics superhero universe may be the most disastrous
            yet". Later that year, Smith starred in director David Frankel's
            drama Collateral Beauty, playing a New York advertising executive
            who succumbs to a deep depression after a personal tragedy. Weeks
            after signing Smith onto the film, his father was diagnosed with
            cancer, from which he died in 2016. As part of his role required him
            to read about religion and the afterlife, he was brought closer to
            the elder Smith, calling the experience "a beautiful way to prepare
            for a movie and an even more majestic way to say goodbye to my
            father." The film marked the lowest box office opening of Will
            Smith's career. The film also received near universal negative
            acclaim from film critics. Hollywood Reporter critic David Rooney
            criticized Smith's performance writing as "the least interesting
            component in a madly overqualified cast". His film Bright was
            distributed via Netflix on December 22, 2017. An urban fantasy, it
            was the most expensive film for Netflix to date. Smith collaborated
            with his director from Suicide Squad, David Ayer. That month, Smith
            launched his own YouTube channel, which as of July 2019 has over 6
            million subscribers and 294 million total views. Also in 2017, Smith
            released the song "Get Lit" a collaboration between him and his
            former group mate Jazzy Jeff. This would also be another critical
            disappointment for Smith, with critics panning the movie. Richard
            Roeper of The Chicago Sun-Times criticized the film and Smith's
            performance writing, "By the time Will Smith barks the line, "Dude,
            you can't go through elf town!"] with 100 percent urgency and
            sincerity in the mindboggling mess that is "Bright," it's clear we
            are watching a truly terrible, mountainous pile of genre-blending
            garbage." Smith performed the soccer 2018 World Cup's official song
            "Live It Up" Smith performed the official song "Live It Up"
            alongside American singer Nicky Jam and Kosovar singer Era Istrefi
            at the closing ceremony of the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Moscow,
            Russia. That September, Smith appeared, alongside Bad Bunny, on the
            Marc Anthony song "Está Rico". Smith portrayed The Genie (originally
            voiced by Robin Williams) in the live-action adaptation of Disney's
            Aladdin, directed by Guy Ritchie. He also participated in the
            soundtracks by recording singles: "Arabian Nights (2019)", "Friend
            Like Me" and "Prince Ali". The film was released on May 24, 2019.
            Aladdin grossed over $1 billion worldwide to become Smith's
            highest-grossing film, surpassing Independence Day. Smith was also
            featured on rapper Logic's song "Don't Be Afraid To Be Different"
            (2019), from his fifth studio album Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.
            Smith appeared as an assassin who faces off against a younger clone
            of himself in Ang Lee's Gemini Man, released on October 11, 2019.
            The film was a box office bomb and received negative reviews from
            critics. Variety's Peter DeBruge called the film "a high-concept
            misfire" and wrote: "In practice, it's been a nearly impossible
            project to get made, passing through the hands of countless actors
            and falling through multiple times because the technology wasn't
            there yet. At least, that's been the excuse, although judging by the
            finished product, it was the script that never lived up to the
            promise of its premise." Later that year, Smith had his second
            starring role in an animated film, in Spies in Disguise, opposite
            Tom Holland. Smith voiced Lance Sterling, a spy who teams up with
            the nerdy inventor who creates his gadgets (Holland). In 2020, he
            reteamed with Martin Lawrence for the third film in their franchise,
            Bad Boys for Life. In 2019, Smith invested $46 million in esports
            organization Gen.G with Smith's Dreamers Fund, which he co-founded
            with Keisuke Honda. In June 2020, it was announced that Smith would
            star in Emancipation, directed by Antoine Fuqua, in which he
            portrays Peter, a runaway slave, who outsmarts hunters and the
            Louisiana swamp on a journey to the Union <br><br></Army><b>2020–present: Memoir
                and King Richard</b> <br> Smith's memoir Will, which was written with Mark
            Manson, the author of The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, was
            published on November 9, 2021, and promoted with a tour. The book is
            a journey of self-knowledge recalling childhood traumas, his
            relationship with his father, and his experiences with ayahuasca. In
            the same year, he and his Westbrook Studios company signed a deal
            with National Geographic. Smith portrayed Richard Williams, father
            and coach of tennis players Venus and Serena Williams, in the 2021
            film King Richard. For his performance, he won the Academy Award for
            Best Actor, Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture
            Drama, and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance
            by a Male Actor in a Leading Role. On February 7, 2022, National
            Geographic announced that Smith would star in a series titled Pole
            to Pole, which will stream on Disney+. The show will follow Smith
            and his film crew as they go on a 26,000-mile (42,000 km) trek from
            the South Pole to the North Pole, crossing all of Earth's biomes and
            spending time in communities along the way. 2022 Oscars
            confrontation Main article: Will Smith–Chris Rock slapping incident
            Further information: 94th Academy Awards During the 94th Academy
            Awards on March 27, 2022, Smith walked onstage and slapped presenter
            and comedian Chris Rock who had made a joke about his wife Jada
            Pinkett Smith's shaved head with a reference to the main protagonist
            in the film G.I. Jane. Smith then returned to his seat and yelled at
            Rock, twice saying "Keep my wife's name out your fucking mouth!"
            Pinkett Smith had been diagnosed with alopecia areata in 2018 and
            would later shave her head due to the condition. The Academy of
            Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) said that Smith was asked
            to leave the ceremony but he refused. Later in the night, Smith was
            named Best Actor for King Richard and apologized to the Academy and
            the other nominees, but not to Rock, in his acceptance speech.
            Following public backlash, Smith issued a formal apology via a
            public Instagram post. ABC, AMPAS, and the Screen Actors Guild
            condemned Smith following the incident, prompting an investigation
            by the Academy's Board of Governors. Rock declined to press charges
            against Smith, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. On
            April 1, 2022, Smith tendered his resignation from the Academy,
            writing in part: I deprived other nominees and winners of their
            opportunity to celebrate and be celebrated for their extraordinary
            work. I am heartbroken. I want to put the focus back on those who
            deserve attention for their achievements and allow the Academy to
            get back to the incredible work it does to support creativity and
            artistry in film. So, I am resigning from membership in the Academy
            of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and will accept any further
            consequences the Board deems appropriate. The AMPAS President David
            Rubin accepted the resignation in an official statement but said
            they would continue their investigation. Smith's resignation means
            he is no longer able to vote on Oscar nominations as a member of the
            Academy. Commentators have speculated that Smith's resignation from
            the Academy and other related fallout from the slap would damage his
            "family brand". On April 8, 2022, the Academy announced its decision
            to ban Smith from future Oscars galas and associated events for a
            period of 10 years. Several film projects that Smith had been
            involved in were put on hold as a result of the controversy. In a
            statement to CNN, Smith stated: "I accept and respect the Academy's
            decision." Smith offered an on camera apology on July 29, saying he
            was "deeply remorseful" for his actions.
